# Deploying NFS Server in Kubernetes
[https://github.com/appscode/third-party-tools/blob/master/storage/nfs/README.md](https://github.com/appscode/third-party-tools/blob/master/storage/nfs/README.md)

1. Create storage ns
`kubectl create ns nfs`

2. Deploy NFS Server

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nfs-server
  namespace: storage
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nfs-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nfs-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nfs-server
        image: k8s.gcr.io/volume-nfs:0.8
        ports:
        - name: nfs
          containerPort: 2049
        - name: mountd
          containerPort: 20048
        - name: rpcbind
          containerPort: 111
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
        volumeMounts:
        - name: storage
          mountPath: /exports
      volumes:
      - name: storage
        hostPath:
          path: /data/nfs # store all data in "/data/nfs" directory of the node where it is running
          type: DirectoryOrCreate # if the directory does not exist then create it
```

`kubectl apply -f nfs-server.yaml'

3. Deploy the NFS service
`kubectl apply -f nfs-service.yaml`

4. Use NFS volume directly in Pod

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: nfs-direct
  namespace: demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command:
    - sleep
    - "3600"
    volumeMounts:
    - name: data
      mountPath: /demo/data
  volumes:
  - name: data
    nfs:
      server: "nfs-service.nfs.svc.cluster.local"
      path: "/nfs-direct" # "nfs-direct" folder must exist inside "/exports" directory of NFS server
```

NOTE:

There is an issue that prevents accessing NFS server through service DNS. However, accessing through IP address works fine. If you face this issue, you have to add IP address of kube-dns Service into your host's /etc/systemd/resolved.conf and restart systemd-networkd, systemd-resolved.

We are using Minikube for this tutorial. Below steps show how we can do this in Minikube.

Get IP address of kube-dns Service.

$ kubectl get service -n kube-system kube-dns
NAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)         AGE
kube-dns   ClusterIP   10.96.0.10   <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP   173m
Look at the CLUSTER-IP field. Here, 10.96.0.10 is the IP address of kube-dns service.

Add the IP address into /etc/systemd/resolved.conf file of Minikube and restart networking stuff.

```
# Login to minikube
$ minikube ssh
# Run commands as root
$ su
# Add IP address in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` file
$ echo "DNS=10.96.0.10" >> /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
# Restart netwokring stuff
$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ systemctl restart systemd-networkd
$ systemctl restart systemd-resolved

```
Now, we will be able to access NFS server using DNS of a Service i.e. {service name}.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local.
